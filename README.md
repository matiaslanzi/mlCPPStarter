# mlCPPStarter
This is a simple C++ project starter.
I thought I would do it for Visual Studio Code for it's the most cross platform IDE I fund, working great on OSX, Linux and Windows.
The project is set up to compile using clang++ deined in the tasks.json file.
To change the name of the generated binary also refer to the tasks.jason file inside the .vscode directory.
